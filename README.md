This project aims to develop a new approach for calculating the Sustainable Cities Development Index – Brazil (IDSC-BR), using dynamic factor models. Based on data sourced from the same institutions that support the original IDSC, the project proposes a new weighting method for the construction of the index.

## Project Objective

The IDSC-BR is a tool designed to measure the sustainable development of Brazilian cities, taking into account various socioeconomic, environmental, and institutional indicators. However, the original weighting method used for the index can be enhanced using more advanced statistical techniques, enabling a more robust and dynamic analysis.

This project proposes a new methodology for calculating the IDSC-BR, employing dynamic factor models to capture the interdependencies and variations of the indicators over time. This will provide a more accurate and adaptable view of the evolution of sustainable development in Brazilian cities.


## Project Structure

1. Data Collection:

> The data will be sourced from the same institutions that provide data for the original IDSC-BR. These include public databases with socioeconomic, environmental, and institutional indicators for Brazilian cities.

> Sources include, but are not limited to: IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), Ministry of Environment, INEP (National Institute for Educational Studies), and other relevant governmental agencies and NGOs.

2. Data Cleaning and Processing:

> After data collection, a cleaning process will be applied to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers.

> The data will be normalized to allow consistent comparisons between different indicators.

3. New Weighting Proposal with Dynamic Factor Models:

> The original IDSC weighting method will be replaced by dynamic factor models, using latent factor analysis to identify the main components influencing the sustainable development of cities.

> Variables will be dynamically weighted based on their contribution to the identified latent factors, considering the interactions between indicators and how these interactions evolve over time.

4. Construction of the New Index:

> Based on the results from the factor analysis, a new sustainable development index will be created, providing an updated and more accurate perspective on Brazilian cities' sustainability.

> The new index will be compared to the original IDSC-BR to evaluate the differences and identify improvements.

5. Visualization and Results:

> Results will be presented through graphs and tables that illustrate the index's variation over time and city comparisons.

> A critical analysis of the results will be conducted, highlighting the implications of the new weighting method.
